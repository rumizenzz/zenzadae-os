# Research Plan: ZenzaDae Group OS VM Development

## Objectives
- Gather technical information for building a branded Arch Linux virtual machine.
- The VM should launch fullscreen from Windows with advanced features.

## Research Breakdown
- **Arch Linux VM Creation & Automation**: Focus on automated installation and optimization.
- **VirtualBox Advanced Configuration**: Investigate command-line management and portable deployment.
- **VM Branding & Customization**: Research desktop environment theming and branding.
- **Windows-VM Integration**: Find methods for seamless startup and control from Windows.
- **Security & Lock-In Mode**: Explore VM hardening and kiosk-mode implementation.
- **Development Tools & Software Packaging**: Look into automated software and development tool setup.

## Key Questions
1. What are the most effective methods for unattended Arch Linux installation in a VM?
2. How can VirtualBox be fully controlled from the command line for VM creation, configuration, and execution?
3. What are the best practices for customizing XFCE/KDE to create a branded experience?
4. How can the VM be launched automatically in fullscreen mode from a Windows host?
5. What are the most effective security measures to create a locked-down kiosk-like environment?
6. How can the installation of a full development environment be automated?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: Arch Linux Wiki, VirtualBox documentation, and official documentation for relevant tools (e.g., Docker, VS Code).
- **Search strategies**: Use specific keywords for each research area, such as "Arch Linux unattended install," "VBoxManage scripting," "XFCE theming," "Windows batch script VirtualBox," "Linux kiosk mode," and "pacman script."

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: Prioritize official documentation, well-regarded community forums (e.g., Arch Linux forums), and reputable technical blogs.
- **Cross-validation**: Cross-reference information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and identify best practices.

## Expected Deliverables
- Technical implementation guides for each research area.
- Command-line examples and automation scripts.
- Best practices and security considerations.
- Troubleshooting and common issues documentation.
- Resource links and official documentation references.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search
- **Justification**: The task is primarily about gathering and synthesizing information from various sources. The Verification-Focused Workflow will be integrated as needed to ensure the quality of the information.
