# Arch Linux VM Creation & Automation Guide

This document provides a guide to creating and automating the installation of an Arch Linux VM for the ZenzaDae Group OS project.

## 1. Automated Installation with `archinstall`

The `archinstall` library is the recommended tool for automated Arch Linux installations. It can be used as a Python library to create fully unattended installation scripts.

### Key `archinstall` Concepts

- **Profiles**: Profiles are used to define the packages and configurations for the installation. You can create custom profiles to meet the specific needs of your project.
- **Hooks**: Hooks allow you to run custom scripts at different stages of the installation process. This is useful for tasks such as branding, security hardening, and installing development tools.
- **Unattended Installation**: By using a Python script, you can fully automate the installation process, from partitioning the disk to installing the desktop environment.

### Example `archinstall` Script

```python
import archinstall

# Set the installation options
archinstall.storage.luks_password = 'your_password'
archinstall.storage.username = 'kiosk'
archinstall.storage.password = 'your_password'
archinstall.storage.hostname = 'zenzadae-os'
archinstall.storage.desktop_environment = 'xfce'

# Create the installation
installation = archinstall.Installer()

# Run the installation
installation.run()
```

## 2. VM-Optimized Arch Linux Configuration

- **Minimal Installation**: Start with a minimal installation and only install the packages you need.
- **VirtualBox Guest Additions**: Install the VirtualBox Guest Additions to improve performance and enable features like seamless mode and shared folders.
- **Lightweight Desktop Environment**: Use a lightweight desktop environment like XFCE or a window manager like Openbox to reduce resource usage.

## 3. Automated Package Installation and System Configuration

- **`pacman`**: Use `pacman` with the `--noconfirm` flag to automate package installation.
- **Configuration Management**: Use a configuration management tool like Ansible or a simple shell script to automate system configuration.
